get\_facts
==========

This is a simple example to show how you can write a runbook to get facts from a device. The code is commented so feel free to take a peak and try to understand what's going on.

You should be able to use the `Vagrantfile` in the `inventory` and run the command `./get_facts.py`.

Feel free to change `getters=["facts", "interfaces"]`, to play with the `nr.filter` or to do whatever other experiments you may want to try out.
